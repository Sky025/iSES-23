The SCOPE attack evaluates logic-locking techniques for constant-propagation vulnerabilities. SCOPE does not require the unlocked design (oracle-less), or any training, which makes it an extremely impactful tool since it treats the design as a black box.

Benchmark Format: SCOPE uses .bench circuits only. Key inputs for locked designs must be named exactly "key input" followed by an integer (for example, keyinput01, keyinput99, ...etc). no other letters, symbols, or spaces are allowed.

Targeted Locking Techniques: We have used benchmarks that were originally generated by Pramod Subramanian's locking tool.

Additionally, we have created randomly inserted MUX-based locked benchmarks, these include c6288 (which is resilient to SAT-based attacks, but not to constant-propagation attacks).

Tool dependency: Please download and install the ABC compiler in the provided folder in order to run the tool. The compiler can be found here:
