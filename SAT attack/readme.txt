The SAT attack can be directly run by following the instructions from the 
official repository:

$ cd bin
$ ./sld ../benchmarks/rnd/c880_enc50.bench ../benchmarks/original/c880.bench

In order to perform SAT on a series of benchmarks, run perform_sat.py and 
validation_sat.py. Make sure to change the paths in the files to suit your 
needs.
